üñºÔ∏è Image Effects Model
This project is a Python-based web app that applies various image processing effects using convolution kernels. It uses Gradio for the user interface and OpenCV for processing images. Users can upload an image and apply filters like sharpening, blurring, edge detection, outline, and more.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
This app uses convolution, a fundamental image processing operation. A kernel (also called a filter or mask) is a small matrix that slides across the image to transform pixel values based on their neighbors.

üßÆ Convolution Steps

Define a kernel (e.g. a 3√ó3 matrix).

Slide the kernel over each pixel in the image.

Multiply the kernel values by the surrounding image pixels.

Replace the center pixel with the result.

Example: Sharpen Kernel

python
Copy
Edit
kernel = np.array([
    [ 0, -1,  0],
    [-1,  5, -1],
    [ 0, -1,  0]
])
This filter enhances edges by emphasizing differences between pixels.

üß™ Available Effects

Sharpen

Blur

Edge Detection

Outline

(and more depending on implementation)

üìö Learn More
This project demonstrates practical image processing using convolution. Kernels can be designed for:

Blurring: Softens the image

Sharpening: Enhances edges

Edge Detection: Highlights transitions

Outlining: Highlights object borders
